🗓️ Day 4: Timing & Logic
Focus: Timers, delays, and smarter responses

Concepts:
delay() vs millis()

Simple state machines

Logic-based control (if-else, comparison ops)

Objectives:
Use millis() for non-blocking blink

Build a timer-based event (e.g., auto-off light)

Combine sensor and timing

Exercises:
LED blinks every 3 seconds without delay()

Turn on fan (LED) if temperature (simulated) exceeds limit for 5 seconds

Button + timeout to trigger special action
