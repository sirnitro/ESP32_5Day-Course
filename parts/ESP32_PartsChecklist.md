# 🧰 Hardware Requirements – 5-Day ESP32 Programming Course

This list includes the essential and optional hardware needed to teach the 5-day ESP32 Basics Bootcamp.

---

## 📦 Core Hardware (1 set per student or student pair)
- **ESP32 Development Board** (e.g., DOIT ESP32 DevKit v1 or similar)
- **Micro USB Cable** (1 per ESP32)
- **Breadboard** (half-size or full-size)
- **Jumper Wires** (male-to-male, at least 20 per student)
- **LEDs** (at least 3 per student, assorted colors)
- **Resistors**:
  - 220Ω (for LEDs)
  - 10kΩ (for button pull-downs)
- **Momentary Push Buttons** (2–3 per student)
- **Potentiometer** (10kΩ recommended, 1 per student)
- **Photoresistor (LDR)** (optional, 1 per student)
- **Multicolor Stickers or Labels** (to mark GPIO pins)

---

## 🖥️ Computer Requirements (per student or pair)
- Laptop or desktop with:
  - USB ports
  - Arduino IDE installed
  - ESP32 board support installed
  - USB-to-Serial drivers (CH340 or CP210x, depending on board)

---

## 🔧 Instructor Essentials
- Spare ESP32 boards (2–3 recommended)
- Extra jumper wires, buttons, resistors, and USB cables
- USB hub or extension cords (if workspace is limited)
- GPIO pinout reference charts or handouts
- Visual aids for teaching (e.g., pull-up diagrams, timing analogies)
- Pre-loaded example projects for live demos

---

## ✨ Optional / Extension Hardware
- **Buzzer or Piezo Speaker** (for sound projects)
- **OLED Display (I2C)** (for visual dashboards)
- **DHT11 or DHT22 Sensor** (temperature/humidity projects)
- **Mini Breadboard Power Supply** (for more advanced builds)
- **Battery Pack or Power Bank** (to unplug for final demos)
